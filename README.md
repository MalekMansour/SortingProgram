# Sorting Program by Malek Mansour

A Python program that allows users to sort numbers using various sorting algorithms. 
The program features a user-friendly graphical interface where you can input numbers, 
select a sorting method, and view the sorted result along with a detailed 
explanation of each step in the sorting process.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Input numbers, select sorting methods, and view results seamlessly.
- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Understand how the sorting algorithm processes your input through detailed steps displayed in real-time.
- **Clear Functionality**: Easily reset the input, output, and explanation sections for a fresh start.

## Sorting Methods

The program includes the following sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted list one item at a time.
- **Selection Sort**: Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region, expanding the sorted region one element at a time.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses partitioning to recursively sort the list.
- **Merge Sort**: Recursively divides the list into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.
- **Heap Sort**: Converts the list into a heap structure to efficiently retrieve the largest/smallest element.
- **Swap Sort**: Focuses on swapping misplaced elements to sort the list.
- **Radix Sort**: Processes numbers digit by digit, based on their significant positions.
- **Shell Sort**: A generalized version of insertion sort that allows exchanges of distant elements.
- **Inverse Sort**: Sorts the list in descending order (reverse sort).
